# Study designs in observational studies
Searching literature to read and understand study designs can be overwelming since the tons of published papers. But even worse, figure it out what prior concepts would be needed to do an in deep exploration of study designs can be dificult. This is my attemp to list (and give an order) articles that I consider go to the point and show practical examples to endorse the concepts effectivelty.     

## Introduction to study designs: getting familiar with _variables_
After the investigator has formulated a research question, the next big step is to know what variables to measure and how to measure them. The last one, is also called operationalization and requires a good understanding of the nature of variables. Thus, getting familiar with variables, their classification, and their properaitities is fundamental before set a designs to our study.
[This](https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717621994334) (part 1) and [This](https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717621996151) article (part 2) provide the fundamentals of variables, they also includes several practical examples and an introduccion to confounding variables, which could be explored in deep [here](10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009758)   

## Study designs
### An outlook on study designs
* [An overview of clinical research: the lay of the land](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07283-5): This one is the first of the series of articles writen by Grimes & Schulz about study designs. This provides a general overview, and highliting the strengths and limitations of each type. 

### Descriptive studies (Including cross-seccional studies)
* [Descriptive studies: what they can and cannot do](10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07373-7): In addition to provide a good understanding about descriptive study, this article underscore the importance to recognize the questions that the investigator have to answer when conducting a descriptive study (the five basic "W") --Who, why, when, where, so what--. 

### Cross-sectional studies (including analytical studies)
* [Cross-sectional studies â€“ what are they good for?](https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.13331): This article is a good starting point to understand one of the most common observational designs: cross-seccional studies. Cross-sectional studies can be either descriptive or analytic. In an analytical approach, aften the investigator will not be able to find a causal relationship, therefore the investigator should be careful when drawing conclusions and the reader should be careful in interpreting the results.  

### Case-control study
* [Case-control studies: research in reverse](10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07605-5)

### Cohort study
* [Cohort studies: marching towards outcomes](10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07500-1): One of the take-home message of this article is that to differentiate Cohort study from case-control, we have to identify when data were collected. Regarding the control group, both case-control design and cohort design have a comparison group (the control in both), but in the first one (case-control), groups are defined by the outcome, while in a cohort study, groups are defined by the exposure.  

### Learning with examples
To reinforse the knowledge gained with explanation articles, the next step before choose the study design that fits better your research question is to look at articles published with good explanation on their methods. Take a look on them and compare how researcher collect their data () and what statistical measures are reported.

#### Cross-seccional, descriptive
What are the patients attitudes towards twin pregnancies and single embryo transfer?
Article [here](10.1093/humrep/dem173)

#### Cross-seccional, analytical
What characteristics differs between women who binge drink in recognized part of pregnancy and women who binge drink in the pre-recognized part of pregnancy?
[_Characteristics of women who binge drink before and after they become aware of their pregnancy_](10.1007/s10654-008-9265-z).

#### Case-control
Does Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated to orofaringeal cancer?
* [This article](10.1056/NEJMoa065497) has a **case-control design**, and here the authors compares 100 patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal cancer (the control group) with 200 patients without oropharyngeal cancer (the case group) to evaluate whther HPV infection is assocaited to oropharyngeal cancer.

#### Cohort study
