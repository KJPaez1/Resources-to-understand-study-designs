# Study designs in observational studies
Searching through the literature to read and understand study designs can be overwhelming due to the vast number of published papers. Even worse, figuring out which prior concepts are needed to conduct an in-depth exploration of the topic can be difficult. This is my attempt to list (and provide an order for) articles that I consider to be straight to the point and to offer practical examples to effectively reinforce the concepts

## Introduction to study designs: getting familiar with _variables_
After the investigator has formulated a research question, the next significant step is to determine which variables to measure and how to measure them. The latter is also called operationalization and requires a good understanding of the nature of variables. Thus, becoming familiar with variables, their classification, and their properties is fundamental before setting the design for our study.
[This](https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717621994334) (part 1) and [This](https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717621996151) article (part 2) provide the fundamentals of variables. They also include several practical examples and an introduction to confounding variables, which could be explored in depth [here](10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009758)   

## Study designs
#### An outlook on study designs
Figure bellow (from Grimes&Schulz) shows the classification of Observational study

![Alt image]()
* [An overview of clinical research: the lay of the land](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07283-5): This one is the first of the series of articles writen by Grimes & Schulz about study designs. This provides a general overview, and highliting the strengths and limitations of each type. 

### Descriptive studies
* [Descriptive studies: what they can and cannot do](10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07373-7): In addition to provide a good understanding about descriptive study, this article underscore the importance to recognize the questions that the investigator have to answer when conducting a descriptive study (the five basic "W") --Who, why, when, where, so what--. 

### Cross-sectional studies
Cross-sectional studies can be descriptive, analytic, or repeated (or serial) cross-seccional study. In an analytical approach, often the investigator will not be able to find a causal relationship, therefore the investigator should be careful when drawing conclusions and the reader should be careful in interpreting the results. 
* [Cross-sectional studies â€“ what are they good for?](https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.13331): This article is a good starting point to understand one of the most common observational designs: cross-seccional studies.
* [Cross-Sectional Studies: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Recommendations](10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.012): This article add information about the pro and cons of cross-seccional studies, as well as common bias and estatistical considerations.


### Case-control study
* [Case-control studies: research in reverse](10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07605-5)

### Cohort study
* [Cohort studies: marching towards outcomes](10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07500-1): One of the take-home message of this article is that cohort study is different from case-control in the way data are collected. Both case-control and cohort design have a comparison group (the control group), but in the case-control, groups are defined by the outcome, while in a cohort design, groups are defined by the exposure.  

### Learning with examples
To reinforse the knowledge gained with explanation articles, the next step before choose the study design that fits better your research question is to look at articles published with good explanation on their methods. Take a look on them and compare how researcher collect their data and what statistical measures are reported.

#### Cross-seccional, descriptive
What are the patients attitudes towards twin pregnancies and single embryo transfer?
Article [here](10.1093/humrep/dem173)

What is the prevalence of dysfunctional breathing in patients treated for asthma in primary care?
Article [here](10.1136/bmj.322.7294.1098)

#### Cross-seccional, analytical
What characteristics differs between women who binge drink in recognized part of pregnancy and women who binge drink in the pre-recognized part of pregnancy?
Article [here](10.1007/s10654-008-9265-z).

Does passive smoking influence on the prevalence of respiratory symptoms, bronchial responsiveness, lung function, and total serum IgE?
Article [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(01)07214-2)

#### Case-control
Does Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated to orofaringeal cancer?
* [This article](10.1056/NEJMoa065497) has a **case-control design**, and here the authors compares 100 patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal cancer (the control group) with 200 patients without oropharyngeal cancer (the case group) to evaluate whther HPV infection is assocaited to oropharyngeal cancer.
