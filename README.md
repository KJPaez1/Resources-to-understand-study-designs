# Resources to understand study designs
This repo includes papers and other resources to understand study design in clinical research. As a matter of fact, all papers of David A. Grimes and his co-authors are included, since these papers are the "must read" for medical students and researchers.

### Introduction to study designs: Getting familiar with variables
After the researcher has found a interesting question that is goint to try to answer, the next big step is to know what varaibles to measure and how to measure them. The last one, is also called operacionalization. Therefore, getting familiar with variables, their classification, and their propiarities is fundamental for a good understanding of study designs.
[This](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07283-5) (part 1) and [This](https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717621996151) article (part 2) provides the fundamentals of variables, and also includes several practical examples. The author also include an introduccion to confounding variables, which could me explored more in deep [here]()   


* [An overview of clinical research: the lay of the land](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07283-5): This papers provides a general overview of study designs in clinical research and also common statistical measures for common outcomes. This is the first of the series of papers about study designs writen by Grimes et al.

* to know the classification of variables in research is key For a good understanding of study designs, as well as their operationalization (How they are going to be measure).
