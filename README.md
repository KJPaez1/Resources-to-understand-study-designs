# Resources to understand study designs in observational studies
This repo includes papers and other resources to understand study design in clinical research. As a matter of fact, all papers of David A. Grimes and his co-authors are included, since these papers are the "must read" for medical students and researchers.

### Introduction to study designs: getting familiar with _variables_
After the researcher has found a interesting question that is goint to try to answer, the next big step is to know what varaibles to measure and how to measure them. The last one, is also called operacionalization. Therefore, getting familiar with variables, their classification, and their propiarities is fundamental for a good understanding of study designs.
[This](https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717621994334) (part 1) and [This](https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717621996151) article (part 2) provides the fundamentals of variables, and also includes several practical examples. The author also include an introduccion to confounding variables, which could me explored more in deep [here](10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009758)   

### Study designs
#### An outlook on study designs
* [An overview of clinical research: the lay of the land](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07283-5): This one is the first of the series of articles writen by Grimes & Schulz about study designs. This provides a general overview, and highliting the sthrengths and limitations of each type. 

#### Descriptive studies
* [Descriptive studies: what they can and cannot do](10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07373-7): In addition to provide a good understanding about descriptive study, this article underscore the importance to recognize the questions that the investigator have to answer when conducting a descriptive study (the five basic "W") --Who, why, when, where, so what--. 

#### Case-control study
* [Case-control studies: research in reverse](10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07605-5)

#### Cohort study
* [Cohort studies: marching towards outcomes](10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07500-1): One of the take-home message of this article is that to differentiate Cohort study from case-control, we have to identify when data were collected. Regarding the control group, both case-control design and cohort design have a comparison group (the control in both), but in the first one (case-control), groups are defined by the outcome, while in a cohort study, groups are defined by the exposure.  

### Learning with examples
To reinforse the knowledge gained with explanation articles, the next step before choose the study design that fits better your research question is to look at articles published with good explanation on their methods. Take a look on them and compare how researcher collect their data () and what statistical measures are reported.

#### Cancer
Does Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated to orofaringeal cancer?
* [This article](10.1056/NEJMoa065497) has a **case-control design**, and here the authors compares 100 patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal cancer (the control group) with 200 patients without oropharyngeal cancer (the case group) to evaluate whther HPV infection is assocaited to oropharyngeal cancer.
